  * Update *backdateToISO* with a valid ISO date, ideally the year/date you opened your account to minimise wasteful requests. The default should be a fine starting point.
  * Fill in the *igUsername* value 
  * Fill in the *igPassword* value
  * Update in any other default settings to your taste
  * Save the plugin
* The plugin will now sync as you have configured it

#### Configuring this plugin locally for development

* Fill in the your `emulatorSettings.json` using the example as a template
* `> yarn start` will run the plugin and dump result to the output/ directory
